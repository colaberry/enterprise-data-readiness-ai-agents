## Key Changes from Original Plan

### Removed Chapters:
- ❌ Chapter 4: Gap Assessment (integrated into Chapter 3)
- ❌ Chapter 5: Building the Business Case (integrated into Chapter 3)
- ❌ Chapters 6-8: Phased Implementation (consolidated into Chapter 3)

### Rationale:
Chapter 3 evolved into a comprehensive 90-day roadmap that includes:
- Gap assessment via archetype comparison (5 starting points)
- Business case via ROI analysis (investment and returns)
- Complete implementation roadmap (week-by-week, Days 1-90)
- This consolidation eliminates redundancy and improves reader experience

### New Structure Benefits:
1. ✅ More actionable (complete roadmap in one chapter)
2. ✅ Less redundancy (no repeated content)
3. ✅ Better flow (Foundation → Implementation → Details → Industry)
4. ✅ Faster to market (3 fewer chapters to write)
