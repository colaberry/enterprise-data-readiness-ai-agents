- All 7 layers from bottom (Real-Time Data Fabric) to top (Self-Service Data Products)
- Key components within each layer
- Dependencies and data flow between layers
- Color-coded for visual distinction

**When to use:**

### Diagram 2: Semantic Flow (`diagram2-semantic-flow.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Illustrates how natural language phrases map to unified data entities across systems.

**What it shows:**
- User query in natural language ("My doctor")
- Semantic Layer resolution process
- Multiple source systems with different identifiers
- Golden ID unification
- Final unified entity for agent consumption

**When to use:**
- Explaining Layer 2 (Semantic Layer) functionality
- Demonstrating entity resolution challenges
- Showing why agents need semantic abstraction

**Rendering:** Left-to-right flowchart

---

### Diagram 3: Observability Dashboard (`diagram3-observability-dashboard.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Shows the metrics and feedback loops monitored by Layer 6.

**What it shows:**
- Data Layer metrics (freshness, volume, quality)
- Model Layer metrics (drift, latency)
- Agent Layer metrics (accuracy, cost)
- Feedback loops to automated fixes

**When to use:**
- Explaining Layer 6 (Observability) capabilities
- Demonstrating continuous learning mechanisms
- Showing how failures trigger improvements

**Rendering:** Graph with colored feedback nodes

---

### Diagram 4: Self-Service Comparison (`diagram4-self-service-comparison.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Contrasts manual data access process with self-service approach.

**What it shows:**
- "Before" workflow: 2-3 weeks, 12 people involved
- "After" workflow: <1 hour, zero meetings
- Time savings and efficiency gains

**When to use:**
- Building business case for Layer 7 (Data Products)
- Demonstrating ROI of self-service infrastructure
- Highlighting operational pain points solved

**Rendering:** Parallel left-to-right flows

---

### Diagram 5: Multi-Agent Query Flow (`diagram5-query-flow-v2.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Sequence diagram showing how a complex query flows through all 7 layers with multiple specialist agents.

**What it shows:**
- User query decomposed into subtasks
- Parallel execution by specialist agents (Scheduling, Insurance)
- Each layer's role in the query pipeline
- Timing and performance metrics
- Final synthesized response

**When to use:**
- Explaining multi-agent orchestration (Layer 7)
- Demonstrating how all layers work together
- Showing real-time performance targets

**Rendering:** Sequence diagram (vertical timeline)

---

### Diagram 6: BI vs Agent Comparison (`diagram6-bi-vs-agent-v2.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Side-by-side comparison of BI Era vs Agent Era architectures.

**What it shows:**
- Traditional BI stack (warehouse, ETL, dashboards)
- Modern agent stack (streaming, RAG, multi-modal storage)
- Key architectural differences
- Evolution from human-mediated to autonomous

**When to use:**
- Explaining "why everything changed"
- Showing gaps in BI-era infrastructure
- Justifying need for modernization

**Rendering:** Side-by-side graph comparison

---

### Diagram 7: Evolution Timeline (`diagram7-evolution-timeline.mermaid`)
**Purpose:** Historical timeline showing evolution from BI Era ‚Üí ML Era ‚Üí Agentic Era.

**What it shows:**
- Three distinct eras (1990-2015, 2015-2023, 2023-present)
- Key technologies and milestones in each era
- Progression from batch to real-time to autonomous

**When to use:**
- Providing historical context
- Showing where organizations are in the journey
- Explaining why legacy approaches are insufficient

**Rendering:** Timeline (horizontal, chronological)

## üé® Rendering Diagrams

### GitHub/GitLab
These diagrams will render automatically when viewing `.mermaid` files on GitHub or GitLab.

**To view:**
1. Navigate to the file in the repository
2. Click on the `.mermaid` file
3. GitHub/GitLab will render it automatically

### Local Markdown Editors
Most modern Markdown editors support Mermaid:
- **VS Code:** Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
- **Obsidian:** Native Mermaid support
- **Typora:** Native Mermaid support
- **IntelliJ/PyCharm:** Install Mermaid plugin

### Online Viewers
If your editor doesn't support Mermaid:
1. Copy diagram code
2. Paste into [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
3. Export as PNG/SVG if needed

### Export to Images
**Using Mermaid CLI:**
```bash
# Install mermaid-cli
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Convert to PNG
mmdc -i diagram1-seven-layers-v2.mermaid -o diagram1.png

# Convert to SVG
mmdc -i diagram1-seven-layers-v2.mermaid -o diagram1.svg

Using Online Editor:

Open mermaid.live
Paste diagram code
Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Export PNG" or "Export SVG"


üé® Customizing Diagrams
Changing Colors
Edit the style lines at the bottom of each diagram:
mermaidstyle NodeName fill:#COLOR
Color palette used:

Layer 7: #e1f5ff (light blue)
Layer 6: #fff4e1 (light orange)
Layer 5: #ffe1e1 (light red)
Layer 4: #f0e1ff (light purple)
Layer 3: #e1ffe1 (light green)
Layer 2: #ffe1f0 (light pink)
Layer 1: #ffffe1 (light yellow)

Adjusting Layout
Flowchart direction:

graph TB = Top to Bottom
graph LR = Left to Right
graph BT = Bottom to Top
graph RL = Right to Left

Adding Nodes
Follow existing pattern:
mermaidNodeID[Display Text]
NodeID --> ConnectedNodeID

üîß Troubleshooting
Diagram Won't Render
Check:

Syntax errors (missing semicolons, brackets)
Invalid node connections
Editor/platform Mermaid version compatibility

Solution: Validate in Mermaid Live Editor first
Diagram Too Large
Solutions:

Split into multiple diagrams
Simplify node labels
Export as image and embed

Layout Issues
Try:

Change direction (TB vs LR)
Adjust node spacing with ::: style classes
Use subgraphs to organize clusters
