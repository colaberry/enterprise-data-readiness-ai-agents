**Enterprise Data Readiness for AI Agents**

---

## 🎯 The Core Problem

**57% of organizations are not AI-ready** despite having "modern" data infrastructure.

**Why?** BI-era systems were built to answer *"What happened?"*  
Agents need to answer *"What should I do right now?"*

## 🏗️ The 7-Layer Solution

| Layer | What It Does | Key Tech | Time to Add |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **L1: Real-Time Fabric** | Streams data in <1 sec | Kafka, CDC, Flink | 2-4 weeks |
| **L2: Semantic Layer** | Maps English to data | dbt, Atlan, ontologies | 3-4 weeks |
| **L3: Multi-Modal Storage** | Right DB for each query | Vector DB, Graph, RDBMS | 4-6 weeks |
| **L4: RAG** | Intelligent retrieval | LangChain, embeddings | 3-5 weeks |
| **L5: Governance** | Dynamic permissions | ABAC, audit logs | 2-3 weeks |
| **L6: Observability** | Monitors everything | Evidently, LangSmith | 2-3 weeks |
| **L7: Data Products** | Self-service + orchestration | LangGraph, CrewAI | 3-4 weeks |

**Total Timeline:** 60-120 days (depending on starting point)

## 🚨 6 Requirements Agents Impose

1. **Sub-second response** (<2 sec) → Needs real-time data + caching
2. **Natural language** → Needs semantic layer + RAG
3. **Cross-domain context** → Needs unified data fabric
4. **Dynamic authorization** → Needs ABAC, not RBAC
5. **Continuous learning** → Needs observability + feedback loops
6. **Auditability** → Needs trace IDs + compliance logging

**If you can't meet these, agents will fail.**

## 🎬 3-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Assess (Week 1-2)
- Complete self-assessment (16 questions, 0-160 points)
- Identify your archetype
- Map layer gaps

### Step 2: Build Business Case (Week 3-4)
- Calculate investment (use Table 3)
- Project ROI (use Table 4)
- Get executive buy-in

### Step 3: Execute 90-Day Plan (Week 5-16)
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-30):** Quick wins (CDC, APIs)
- **Phase 2 (Days 31-60):** Scale (RAG, vector DB)
- **Phase 3 (Days 61-90):** Governance + observability

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

**By Day 30:**
- ✅ First test agent running internally
- ✅ Critical data sources have real-time APIs
- ✅ Basic quality monitoring in place

**By Day 60:**
- ✅ Production-grade vector DB operational
- ✅ Security and governance enforced
- ✅ Agent passing internal pilots

**By Day 90:**
- ✅ First production agent deployed
- ✅ All 7 layers operational
- ✅ Team trained, platform ready for agent #2

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating Layer 2** → Semantic layer takes longer than expected
2. **Skipping Layer 6** → No observability = blind to failures
3. **Big Bang deployment** → Start with 1-2 agents, prove value, then scale
4. **Ignoring governance** → ABAC is critical, especially for regulated industries
5. **Wrong archetype self-assessment** → Be honest about your starting point
