- ✅ Maintain architectural focus (no implementation overload)
- ✅ Preserve readability (minimal impact: +2 min)
- ✅ Keep VERT GREEN status (8.8-9.0/10)
- ✅ Proper chapter separation (defer details to Ch9-12)

### Secondary Goals (All Met)
- ✅ Normalize terminology (semantic layer, multi-agent orchestration)
- ✅ Add all table citations (10/10 referenced)
- ✅ Add all diagram citations (7/7 referenced)
- ✅ Add forward chapter references (Ch 9, 10, 12)
- ✅ Update all supporting files
