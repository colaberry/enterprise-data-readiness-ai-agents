## Table 1: Layer-to-Requirement Mapping

**Purpose:** Shows which architectural layers address which agent requirements

| Agent Requirement | Primary Layers | Supporting Layers | Why This Matters |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sub-second response times** | L1 (Real-Time Fabric), L4 (RAG) | L3 (Optimized Storage), L7 (Parallel Agents) | Batch ETL and slow queries kill agent UX |
| **Natural language understanding** | L2 (Semantic Layer), L4 (RAG) | L3 (Vector DB), L7 (Multi-Agent) | Agents speak English, not SQL |
| **Cross-domain context** | L1 (Real-Time Fabric), L4 (RAG) | L2 (Entity Resolution), L3 (Multi-Modal), L7 (Orchestration) | Real questions span multiple systems |
| **Dynamic authorization** | L5 (ABAC Governance) | L6 (Audit Logging), L7 (Per-Agent Scoping) | Different users, different permissions, same agent |
| **Continuous learning** | L6 (Observability & Feedback) | L1 (Fresh Data), L4 (Retrieval Quality) | Agents improve from every interaction |
| **Trustability & auditability** | L5 (Governance), L6 (Observability) | L2 (Lineage), L4 (Citations), L7 (Multi-Agent Logs) | "How did the agent decide that?" must have clear answer |

**Key Insight:** No single layer solves multiple requirements. All seven layers work together as an integrated system.

## Table 2: BI Systems vs Agent Systems (Extended Comparison)

**Purpose:** Illustrates fundamental architectural differences between BI-era and Agentic-era requirements

| Dimension | BI Systems | Agent Systems | Architectural Implication |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Response time** | Minutes to hours acceptable | <2s (single), <3s (multi-agent) | Real-time fabric (L1), caching (L4), parallel processing (L7) |
| **Data freshness** | Daily/weekly batch okay | Sub-minute required | CDC, streaming (L1) |
| **Query patterns** | Known, predefined reports | Unpredictable, natural language | Semantic layer (L2), RAG (L4) |
| **User interface** | Visual dashboards | Conversational text | NL understanding (L2, L4) |
| **Decision maker** | Human analyst | Autonomous agent(s) | Trust, auditability (L5, L6), orchestration (L7) |
| **Access control** | Static, role-based (RBAC) | Dynamic, context-aware (ABAC) | Real-time policy evaluation (L5) |
| **Data types** | Primarily structured | Structured + unstructured | Multi-modal storage (L3), embeddings (L4) |
| **Query complexity** | Aggregations, joins | Semantic search, reasoning, coordination | Vector DB, knowledge graphs (L3), orchestration (L7) |
| **Feedback loops** | Periodic reviews (quarterly) | Continuous, automated (real-time) | Observability (L6), model retraining |
| **Auditability** | Quarterly audit reports | Every query logged with trace IDs | Real-time audit trails (L5) |
| **Scale** | Hundreds of users | Thousands of users, millions of queries | Self-service, APIs (L7) |
| **Failure impact** | User waits, tries again later | User loses trust, abandons system | Reliability, observability (L6) |
| **Data discovery** | Analyst knows where data lives | Agent must discover dynamically | Data catalog, products (L7) |
| **Performance optimization** | Query tuning, indexes | Caching, parallelization, reranking, embedding optimization | RAG optimization (L4) |
| **Cost model** | Infrastructure + licenses (fixed) | Per-query LLM costs + infrastructure (variable) | Cost tracking, optimization (L6) |
| **Model management** | Not applicable | Embeddings, LLMs need versioning/monitoring | Model registry (L3), observability (L6) |
| **Coordination** | N/A (single user, single system) | Multi-agent orchestration required | Orchestration frameworks (L7) |
| **Context sharing** | N/A | Secure memory bus, trace propagation | Sandboxed agents, encrypted channels (L5, L7) |

**Bottom Line:** BI thinking is batch, human-mediated, report-oriented. Agent thinking is real-time, autonomous, conversation-oriented with specialized coordination.
