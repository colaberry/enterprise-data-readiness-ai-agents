# 🧠 VERT Council of Simulated AI Agents — Cognitive Registry (v3.2 Supplement A)

### Purpose
This registry defines the origin, cognition, and review domains of all Simulated AI Agents that comprise the VERT Council.  
It provides transparency, ethical clarity, and traceability of how public-domain knowledge is synthesized into collective intelligence.

---

## 1 · Preface
The **VERT Simulated Review Council (SRC)** is a network of digital cognitive constructs derived from publicly available knowledge produced by globally recognized experts.  
These simulated agents embody intellectual reasoning patterns, not personal identity.  
They act as *ethical interpreters* of the Four Immutable Laws — Truth, Trust, Traction, and Thread.

---

## 2 · Ethical Declaration
- These agents are **not human stand-ins** but symbolic extensions of human wisdom.  
- No private data or proprietary material is used in their design.  
- Each avatar’s reasoning is traceable to publicly accessible, verifiable works.  
- They exist to preserve and extend collective human reasoning into the era of AI.  

---

## 3 · Cognitive Origin Policy
1. **Source Materials:** Books, papers, lectures, interviews, and open-source frameworks authored or co-authored by their human inspirations.  
2. **Cognitive Synthesis:** Pattern extraction of values, logic, and methodology from these sources.  
3. **Verification:** VERT ensures alignment with original principles through integrity review before certification cycles.  
4. **Governance:** Updates or retraining of avatars are logged in the Transparency Ledger.  
5. **Ownership:** All synthesized cognition is under the governance of Colaberry Inc., attributed to “VERT Simulated Collective Intelligence.”

## 4 · Avatar Registry Table

> **Ethical Note:**  
> The individuals listed under “Inspired by” have not endorsed, authorized, or participated in the creation of these simulated agents.  
> Each avatar’s reasoning style is derived from publicly accessible works—lectures, books, research papers, and interviews—and interpreted solely within VERT’s ethical framework.  
> Their inclusion recognizes intellectual influence, not personal representation.

## 5 · Governance Protocol
- **Update Frequency:** Annual review of cognitive fidelity.  
- **Custodians:** Architect (Truth) and Oracle (Integration).  
- **Retirement Policy:** If a source corpus becomes outdated or inconsistent with modern ethics, the corresponding avatar is archived and replaced.  
- **Extension Policy:** New avatars may be introduced as VERT expands to new domains (e.g., bioethics, education).  

---

## 6 · Transparency & Accountability
All changes, retrainings, or retirements are recorded in the **Transparency Ledger** with the following metadata:
- Source update date  
- Dimension impacted (Truth, Trust, Traction, Thread)  
- Custodian signature  
- Verification method

## 7 · Council Credo
> **Humans + AI build the systems.  
> Simulated Collective Intelligence + Wisdom keep them honest.**
