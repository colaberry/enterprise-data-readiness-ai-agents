# VERT Trust Audit Framework v1.0 (Codex Edition)

### Alignment:
HIPAA · SOC 2 · NIST AI RMF · ISO/IEC 42001 · OECD AI Principles · GDPR (as a benchmark standard)

---

## 1. Purpose
This framework operationalizes **Article 5.4 — The Prescriptive Trust Protocol** of the VERT Codex.  
It ensures that every certified artifact or system adheres to ethical, compliant, and governance-ready practices.  
Used by the **Governance Sentinel** and **Ethicist-Humanist**, it verifies readiness in the Trust dimension.

---

## 2. How to Use
1. Review each of the 20 audit items below.  
2. Score each item from **1 to 5**, where:  
   - 1 = Ad hoc  
   - 2 = Emerging  
   - 3 = Defined  
   - 4 = Managed  
   - 5 = Embedded  
3. Provide evidence links and reviewer notes.  
4. Both the Governance Sentinel and Ethicist-Humanist sign off at completion.
