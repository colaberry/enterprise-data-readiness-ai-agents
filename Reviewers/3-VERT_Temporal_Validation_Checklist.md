# VERT Temporal Validation Checklist (Article 1.3 — v3.1)

### Purpose
This checklist enforces **Article 1.3 — Timeliness and Temporal Validity** under the Law of Truth.  
Its purpose is to ensure that all time-sensitive data, facts, and statements are verified as current **as of the publication or certification date.**

**Custodian:** Architect Persona (with Oracle support)  
**Frequency:** Every review or re-certification event

## 1. Verification Instructions

1. Identify all date-specific statements (e.g., “as of 2024,” “currently,” “by 2025,” etc.).  
2. Validate each against authoritative public or vendor sources.  
3. Update outdated language and record evidence in the Transparency Ledger.  
4. Record verification date, sources, and reviewer initials.
