# The Colaberry Codex (TCC) - Lean Edition

**Writing Standards for "Enterprise Data Readiness for AI Agents"**

Version 1.1.0 | October 21, 2025 | Ram Katamaraja, CEO Colaberry Inc.

---

## Core Principles (The Non-Negotiables)

1. **Evidence-based:** Major claims need citations <18 months old
2. **URLs:** Every product gets official URL on first mention
3. **Healthcare-only:** All examples use Meridian Health Systems
4. **No internal jargon:** Never use "VERT", "TCC", "Four-T" in reader content
5. **Standard terms:** Use exact terminology from glossary
6. **Healthcare context:** Patient (not customer), encounter (not transaction)
7. **Meridian consistency:** Use exact figures from canonical reference
8. **Chapter flow:** Every chapter connects to previous and bridges to next
9. **Cite visuals:** Reference all tables/diagrams with exact titles
10. **Current tech:** Indicate maturity status (production-ready/maturing/experimental)

---

## Section 1: Evidence & Attribution

### TCC-001: Evidence Required
Every statistic, benchmark, or best practice needs a citation.

**Needs citation:**
- "95% of GenAI projects fail" ‚Üí cite MIT NANDA study
- "ABAC evaluation <10ms" ‚Üí cite NIST documentation
- "Semantic layer improves accuracy 60% ‚Üí 85%" ‚Üí cite vendor case study

**No citation needed:**
- Colaberry's own frameworks (7-layer architecture, INPACT‚Ñ¢)
- Narrative storytelling
- Explanations of already-cited concepts

**Citation age limits:**
- Statistics/research: <18 months (prefer <12)
- Technology: <12 months
- Regulations: Current version only

### TCC-002: Attribution Format
```markdown
"[Finding from source], [context]. [#]"

Example:
"MIT NANDA examined 300+ GenAI initiatives. Finding: 95% fail to achieve ROI. [1]"

References:
[1] Challapally, A., et al. (2025, July). "The GenAI Divide." MIT NANDA. [URL]
```

### TCC-003: Colaberry IP
Attribute our frameworks clearly:
```markdown
"Colaberry's 7-layer agent-ready data architecture addresses six capabilities..."
"Ram Katamaraja synthesized these patterns from 30 years of implementations..."
```

---

## Section 2: Terminology (Use Exactly)

### TCC-010: Standard Terms

**Architecture:**
- "7-layer agent-ready data architecture" (never "7-layer framework")
- "INPACT‚Ñ¢" OR "Six Agent Capabilities" (never "six requirements")
- "Multi-agent orchestration" (never "agent coordination")

**Layers (use exact names):**
- L1: Real-Time Data Fabric
- L2: Unified Semantic Layer
- L3: Multi-Modal Storage
- L4: Intelligent Retrieval (RAG)
- L5: Agent-Aware Governance
- L6: Observability & Feedback
- L7: Self-Service Data Products & Multi-Agent Orchestration

### TCC-011: Forbidden Terms (Reader-Facing Content)
Never use in published chapters:
- ‚ùå "VERT Council" / "VERT Ethics Audit" / "VERT score"
- ‚ùå "Four-T framework" (Truth, Trust, Traction, Thread)
- ‚ùå "TCC-compliant" / "The Colaberry Codex"
- ‚ùå Any reviewer persona names

Use instead: "independent ethics review" or omit entirely

### TCC-012: Healthcare Terminology

| Use This | Never This |
|----------|------------|
| Patient | Customer, client |
| Encounter, visit, appointment | Transaction, order |
| Service, procedure | Product |
| Admissions, encounters | Revenue, sales |
| Provider, physician, clinician | Employee, staff |
| EHR (Electronic Health Record) | Patient database |
| PHI (Protected Health Information) | Sensitive data |

---

## Section 3: Examples & Case Studies

### TCC-020: Healthcare Context Only
ALL examples must use Meridian Health Systems. No retail, banking, or mixed industry examples.

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```
"When a customer adds items to cart (like a patient booking appointment)..."
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```
"When a care coordinator asks 'Show me patients needing diabetes follow-up', 
the semantic layer translates to diagnosis codes E11.*, HbA1c > 7.0..."
```

### TCC-021: Meridian Canonical Reference
Use EXACT figures. Never round or approximate.

**Investment:** $1.23M (not ~$1.2M, not "about $1.2M")
**Duration:** 90 days (not "3 months", not "~90 days")
**Agents deployed:** 6 (not "several", not "multiple")
**ROI:** 477% (not "over 400%", not "~480%")
**Payback:** 10 weeks (not "about 3 months")
**Return:** $7.1M ($6.3M savings + $800K revenue)
**Start readiness:** 28/100 (BI-First archetype)
**End readiness:** 85/100
**SLOs:** Data freshness 25 seconds, NDCG 0.94, API availability 99.92%

Before writing Meridian example: Check these figures. Copy exactly. Never vary.

---

## Section 4: URLs & Citations

### TCC-030: URLs Required
Every product/technology needs official URL on first mention per chapter.

```markdown
‚úÖ CORRECT:
[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) is a managed vector database optimized 
for semantic search.

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is an open-source distributed 
event streaming platform.
```

Even if URL in Chapter 1, provide again in Chapter 5 (readers may skip chapters).

### TCC-031: Multiple Options
Provide 2-3 examples per category, not just one vendor.

```markdown
‚úÖ CORRECT:
"Vector databases include [Pinecone](url) (managed), [Weaviate](url) 
(open-source), and [Qdrant](url) (high-performance)."

‚ùå WRONG:
"Use Pinecone for vector database."
```

### TCC-032: URL Testing
Before publication:
- Click every URL (100%)
- No 404s allowed
- Mark paywalls: "(requires subscription)"
- Fix broken: Use web.archive.org or find replacement

---

## Section 5: Technology Guidance

### TCC-040: Selection Criteria
Never just recommend one tool. Show options, criteria, trade-offs.

**Pattern:**
```markdown
Vector Database Selection:

Options:
- [Pinecone](url): Managed, auto-scaling, higher cost
- [Weaviate](url): Self-hosted, flexible, ops overhead
- [Qdrant](url): High-performance, Rust-based, newer

Choose based on:
- Prioritize hands-off ‚Üí Pinecone
- Prioritize flexibility ‚Üí Weaviate
- Prioritize performance ‚Üí Qdrant

Trade-offs:
- Managed: Easy but less control, higher cost
- Self-hosted: Control but ops complexity
- Performance: Fast but less mature ecosystem
```

### TCC-041: Version Neutrality
Avoid specific version numbers unless critical.

‚úÖ "Use current stable release of Apache Kafka"
‚úÖ "As of October 2025, Pinecone offers managed services..."
‚ùå "Install Apache Kafka v3.4.2"

### TCC-042: Technology Maturity Status
Indicate status clearly:

- **Production-ready:** LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen
- **Rapidly maturing:** MCP (mainstream adoption but requires security expertise)
- **Experimental:** Alpha releases, limited production use
- **Deprecated:** Avoid for new projects

For MCP (Oct 2025): Note mainstream adoption + security considerations required.

---

## Section 6: Visual Elements

### TCC-050: Diagrams Required
Complex concepts need diagrams:
- Multi-component architectures
- Process flows
- Comparisons (BI vs Agent)
- Relationships (entity resolution)

### TCC-051: Generic vs Specific
Use generic terms in diagrams UNLESS comparing specific vendors.

Generic: "Vector Database" ‚Üí "Query Results" ‚Üí "LLM"
Specific: Only when showing "Pinecone vs Weaviate vs Qdrant"

### TCC-052: Reference All Visuals
All diagrams and tables must be:
1. Numbered and titled
2. Referenced in text with exact title

```markdown
**Diagram 1: Seven-Layer Architecture**

[diagram content]

In text: "The seven-layer stack (Diagram 1: Seven-Layer Architecture) shows..."
```

---

## Section 7: Chapter Integration

### TCC-060: Opening Connection
Every chapter connects to previous:

```markdown
‚úÖ CORRECT:
"Chapter 0 established that agents require six capabilities: sub-second response, 
natural language understanding, cross-domain context, dynamic authorization, 
continuous learning, trustability.

The question becomes: What architecture delivers all six?

This chapter presents the answer..."
```

### TCC-061: Bridge to Next
Every chapter ends with explicit bridge:

```markdown
Template:
In [current chapter], we [established] [key points].

[Next chapter] builds on this by [what's next].

[Transition question creating momentum]

Let's [action verb] [topic]...
```

### TCC-062: No Contradictions
- Same terminology across all chapters
- Same Meridian figures across all chapters
- Same framework names (established in Ch 0/1)
- No conflicting statistics

---

## Section 8: Voice & Audience

### TCC-070: Professional but Accessible
Target: CDOs, CTOs, VPs Data, Data Architects

‚úÖ **Good:**
```
"Your data systems were built for patience. Overnight batch jobs. Queries 
taking 9-13 seconds. That worked when humans analyzed reports over coffee. 
It fails when agents must respond at conversation speed."
```

‚ùå **Too academic:**
```
"Contemporary enterprise data architectures exhibit temporal latency 
characteristics incompatible with real-time agentic requirements..."
```

‚ùå **Too casual:**
```
"So your data warehouse is like, totally not ready for AI, right? LOL üöÄ"
```

### TCC-071: Acronyms
Define on first use per chapter. Add acronym list at chapter end.

```markdown
First use: "Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) evaluates..."
Later: "The ABAC policy engine..."

Chapter end:
## Acronyms
- ABAC: Attribute-Based Access Control
- CDC: Change Data Capture
- RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
```
