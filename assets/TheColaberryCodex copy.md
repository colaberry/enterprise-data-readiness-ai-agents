**In-Text Citation Patterns:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

First reference (full):
"The complete architecture is shown in Diagram 1 (Seven-Layer Architecture)."

Subsequent references (short):
"As shown in Diagram 1, Layer 5 handles governance."
"Diagram 1 illustrates the dependencies between layers."

Cross-chapter reference:
"The semantic flow (see Diagram 2 in Chapter 1) shows entity resolution."
```

**Multiple References to Same Diagram:**
```markdown
✅ ACCEPTABLE:
"Diagram 5 (Multi-Agent Query Flow) shows how the router agent delegates to 
specialists. In Diagram 5, notice how each specialist queries different data 
sources in parallel. The orchestration pattern in Diagram 5 enables sub-3-second 
response times."

Multiple references OK when explaining complex diagram in detail.
```

**Diagram File Naming:**
```
Format: diagram[#]_[descriptive-name].[extension]

Examples:
diagram1_seven_layers.mermaid
diagram2_semantic_flow.mermaid
diagram5_query_flow.mermaid
diagram8_inference_flow.mermaid
```

### 6.4 Table Citation Requirements
**Rule ID:** TCC-VISUAL-004  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** Good practices from Chapter 1

**Rule:** Every table must have numbered caption and be cited in text with exact caption name.

**Table Format:**
```markdown
**Table #: Exact Caption Name**

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data     | Data     | Data     |

**In-text reference:**
"Investment requirements vary by company size, as shown in Table 3 (Investment 
by Company Size), with mid-size organizations typically investing $748K-$1.49M."
```

**Caption Naming Guidelines:**

✅ **Good Captions:**
- Descriptive and specific: "Investment by Company Size"
- Title case: "Layer-to-Requirement Mapping"
- Complete thought: "ROI Scenarios (Mid-Size Company, $1.2M Investment)"

❌ **Poor Captions:**
- Too generic: "Comparison Table"
- Abbreviated: "Inv by Size"
- Too long: "Complete Analysis of Investment Requirements Broken Down by Organization Size Including Infrastructure, Labor, and Vendor Costs"

**In-Text Citation Patterns:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

First reference (full citation):
"As detailed in Table 3 (Investment by Company Size), mid-size organizations..."

Subsequent references (short):
"Table 3 shows mid-size organizations invest $748K-$1.49M."
"See Table 3 for complete breakdown."

Comparing tables:
"While Table 3 shows investment costs, Table 4 (ROI Scenarios) demonstrates returns."
```

**Cross-Chapter Table References:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:
"For embedding model selection criteria, see Table 8 (Embedding Model Selection 
Matrix) in Chapter 1."

Format: Table # (Caption Name) in Chapter #
```

**Multiple Tables in Sequence:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:
"The seven-layer architecture addresses six agent capabilities (Table 1: 
Layer-to-Requirement Mapping), requiring different investments by organization 
size (Table 3: Investment by Company Size), with returns varying by deployment 
scope (Table 4: ROI Scenarios)."

Multiple tables OK when making connected points.
```

---

### 7.2 Cross-Reference Format
**Rule ID:** TCC-ORG-002  
**Priority:** High  
**Source:** Chapter continuity requirements

**Rule:** Use consistent format for all cross-references (internal and cross-chapter).

**Internal References (Same Chapter):**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

Layer reference:
"Layer 5 (Agent-Aware Governance) handles access control..."
"See Layer 5 for governance details."

Table reference:
"As shown in Table 3 (Investment by Company Size)..."
"Table 3 breaks down costs by organization size."

Diagram reference:
"Diagram 2 (Semantic Flow) illustrates entity resolution."
"The flow shown in Diagram 2 maps concepts to data structures."

Section reference:
"As discussed in the Multi-Modal Storage section..."
"See Section 3.1 for archetype examples."
```

**Forward References (To Later Chapters):**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

Chapter reference:
"Chapter 10 (RAG Architecture Best Practices) provides implementation details."
"Implementation patterns are covered in Chapter 6 (90-Day Roadmap)."

Specific content:
"For complete audit schema, see Chapter 9, Layer 5 section."
"Detailed orchestration examples appear in Chapter 11."

With context:
"While this chapter introduces RAG concepts, Chapter 10 shows you how to 
implement hybrid search, reranking, and confidence handling in production."
```

**Backward References (To Earlier Chapters):**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

Chapter reference:
"As established in Chapter 0, agents require six fundamental capabilities."
"Recall from Chapter 1, Layer 5 handles dynamic authorization."

Concept callback:
"The Six Agent Capabilities (Chapter 0) drive this architectural design."
"Meridian's journey (introduced in Chapter 0) demonstrates these patterns."

Building on previous:
"Building on the 7-layer architecture from Chapter 1, this chapter details 
Layer 4 implementation."
```

**External References (To Companion Guides):**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT PATTERNS:

Guide reference:
"For detailed implementation, see DETAILED_GUIDE.md, Layer 4 section."
"Complete compatibility matrix available in DETAILED_GUIDE.md."

Exercise reference:
"Practice assessing your readiness using Exercise 1 in chapter1_exercises.md."

Table file reference:
"See Table 8 in chapter1_tables.md for complete embedding model comparison."
```

**Avoid These Patterns:**
```markdown
❌ INCORRECT:

Vague reference:
"As discussed earlier..." (which section?)
"See previous chapter..." (which chapter?)

Ambiguous:
"The table above..." (might not be directly above)
"In the diagram..." (which diagram?)

Broken structure:
"See Section 5.3.2.1" (too granular, TOC doesn't go that deep)
```

---

### 7.3 Table of Contents Depth
**Rule ID:** TCC-ORG-003  
**Priority:** Low  
**Source:** Documentation usability standards

**Rule:** TOC should go 2-3 levels deep maximum.

**Optimal Depth:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT (2-3 levels):

## Table of Contents

### Chapter 1: The 7-Layer Architecture
- Introduction: The Meridian Moment
- Part 1: The Fundamental Shift
  - What BI Systems Were Built For
  - What Agents Require
- Part 2: The Seven Layers
  - Layer 1: Real-Time Data Fabric
  - Layer 2: Unified Semantic Layer
  - Layer 3: Multi-Modal Storage
  [etc.]
- Summary

Level 1: Chapter
Level 2: Major parts
Level 3: Individual sections
```

**Avoid:**
```markdown
❌ TOO DEEP (4+ levels):

### Chapter 1: The 7-Layer Architecture
- Part 2: The Seven Layers
  - Layer 1: Real-Time Data Fabric
    - Components
      - Change Data Capture
        - Debezium
        - AWS DMS
        - Azure Data Factory
      - Event Streaming
        - Apache Kafka
        - AWS Kinesis
    [etc.]

Problem: Too granular, overwhelming, hard to scan
```
```markdown
❌ TOO SHALLOW (1 level):

### Chapter 1: The 7-Layer Architecture
- Introduction
- Content
- Summary

Problem: Not enough structure, doesn't help navigation
```

**TOC Formatting:**
```markdown
Use hierarchy indicators:

# = Main chapter heading
## = Major part/section
### = Subsection
- = Bullet (for items within subsection)

Example:
# Chapter 1: The 7-Layer Architecture

## Introduction
- The Meridian Moment

## Part 1: The Fundamental Shift
### What BI Systems Were Built For
### What Agents Require

## Part 2: The Seven Layers
### Layer 1: Real-Time Data Fabric
### Layer 2: Unified Semantic Layer
[etc.]
```

## Section 8: Integration & Continuity

### 8.1 Inter-Chapter Narrative Flow
**Rule ID:** TCC-INTEG-001  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Source:** Chapter 0 → Chapter 1 continuity requirement

**Rule:** Chapters must flow as ONE continuous story, not standalone documents.

**Required Elements:**

**1. Opening Connection to Previous Chapter:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

Chapter 0 established that agents require six fundamental capabilities: sub-second 
response times, natural language understanding, cross-domain context, dynamic 
authorization, continuous learning, and trustability.

The question becomes: What architecture delivers all six?

This chapter presents the answer—a 7-layer agent-ready data architecture that 
addresses each capability systematically...
```

**2. Consistent Story Thread:**

Use same characters, organizations, metrics across chapters:
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

Chapter 0: "Meridian invested $1.23M over 90 days..."
Chapter 1: "Meridian's $1.23M investment built the 7-layer architecture..."
Chapter 6: "During Meridian's 90-day transformation, Phase 1 focused on..."

Consistency: Same dollar amount, same timeframe, same company name
```

**3. No Contradictions:**
```markdown
❌ INCORRECT:

Chapter 0: "Agents require six capabilities"
Chapter 1: "The five critical requirements for agents"

Contradiction: Six vs. five
```

**4. Terminology Continuity:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

Chapter 0: "Six Agent Capabilities"
Chapter 1: "These six capabilities (from Chapter 0) map to the 7 layers..."
Chapter 2: "Each of the six capabilities requires..."

Term established in Chapter 0, used consistently throughout
```

**5. No Unnecessary Repetition:**
```markdown
❌ INCORRECT (redundant):

Chapter 0: [3 pages explaining Meridian's 15-year infrastructure evolution]
Chapter 1: [3 pages re-explaining same Meridian history]

Should be:

Chapter 0: [Full Meridian story]
Chapter 1: "As we saw in Meridian's journey (Chapter 0), traditional BI infrastructure..."

Brief callback, not full repetition
```

**Continuity Checklist:**

Before publishing Chapter N:
- [ ] Opens with reference to Chapter N-1
- [ ] Uses same terminology as previous chapters
- [ ] Case study details match canonical reference
- [ ] No contradictions with earlier claims
- [ ] Builds on concepts without full re-explanation
- [ ] Ends with bridge to Chapter N+1

---

### 8.2 Bridge Paragraphs
**Rule ID:** TCC-INTEG-002  
**Priority:** High  
**Source:** Chapter flow requirements

**Rule:** Every chapter ending must have explicit bridge to next chapter.

**Bridge Paragraph Template:**
```markdown
**Structure:**

In [current chapter], we [established/explored/demonstrated] [key points].

[Next chapter] builds on this foundation by [what's next].

[Transition question or statement that creates momentum]

Let's [action verb] [topic]...
```

**Complete Examples:**

**Example 1: Chapter 0 → Chapter 1 Bridge**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

In this chapter, we established that agents require six fundamental capabilities: 
sub-second response times, natural language understanding, cross-domain context, 
dynamic authorization, continuous learning, and trustability. These capabilities 
emerged from studying hundreds of production agent deployments across industries.

Chapter 1 builds on this foundation by presenting the 7-layer agent-ready data 
architecture that delivers these capabilities. Each layer addresses specific 
requirements, and they work together as an integrated system.

The question becomes: How exactly do these layers work together?

Let's explore the architecture that makes agent-ready data possible...
```

**Example 2: Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 Bridge**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

In this chapter, we explored the complete 7-layer agent-ready data architecture, 
from real-time data fabric (Layer 1) to self-service data products (Layer 7). 
We saw how Meridian Health Systems implemented this architecture, achieving 
477% ROI with a 10-week payback.

Chapter 2 dives deeper into the Five Pillars that make this architecture 
operational: Real-Time Everywhere, Meaning Over Schema, Trust by Design, 
Intelligence at the Edge, and Products Not Projects. These pillars transform 
the seven layers from concept to implementation.

How do you actually build these pillars in your organization?

Let's explore the operational principles that bring agent-ready architecture to life...
```

**What Makes a Good Bridge:**

✅ **Good bridges:**
- Summarize current chapter (1-2 sentences)
- Preview next chapter specifically (not vague)
- Create momentum/curiosity
- Use transition question when appropriate
- End with forward-looking action

❌ **Poor bridges:**
```markdown
❌ "In the next chapter, we'll discuss more about data architecture."

Problems:
- Vague ("more about data architecture")
- No specific preview
- No momentum
- Doesn't connect to current chapter
```

---

### 8.3 Cross-Chapter Reference Consistency
**Rule ID:** TCC-INTEG-003  
**Priority:** High  
**Source:** Multi-chapter coordination

**Rule:** References to other chapters must be accurate and maintained when content changes.

**Reference Format:**
```markdown
**When referencing specific content:**

"For complete audit schema specification, see Chapter 9, Layer 5 (Agent-Aware 
Governance) section."

Components:
- Chapter number: 9
- Section name: Layer 5 (Agent-Aware Governance)
- Specific topic: audit schema specification

Specific enough to find, general enough to remain accurate if section restructures slightly.
```

**Maintenance Process:**

**When Chapter N changes structure:**

1. **Identify all references TO Chapter N** (from other chapters)
2. **Update each reference** if section names/numbers changed
3. **Test navigation** (can readers find referenced content?)
4. **Document in version history**

**Example:**
```markdown
Chapter 9 v1.0 had: "Layer 5 Section: Audit Logging"
Chapter 9 v2.0 renamed to: "Layer 5 Section: Comprehensive Audit Design"

Action needed:
- Find all chapters referencing "Audit Logging" in Chapter 9
- Update to "Comprehensive Audit Design"
- Or use generic reference: "Chapter 9, Layer 5 section on auditing"
```

**Generic vs. Specific References:**

**Use specific when:**
- Content is stable (unlikely to restructure)
- Readers need exact location
- Chapter already published

**Use generic when:**
- Content may restructure
- Chapter still in development
- General topic area sufficient
```markdown
✅ SPECIFIC (stable):
"For the complete seven-layer architecture diagram, see Diagram 1 in Chapter 1."

✅ GENERIC (flexible):
"For RAG implementation patterns, see Chapter 10 (RAG Architecture Best Practices)."

Not: "see Chapter 10, Section 3.2.1, subsection on hybrid search"
(too brittle, will break if restructured)
```

**Forward Reference Maintenance:**

When writing Chapter 3, referencing future Chapter 10:
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:

"Implementation details for RAG infrastructure appear in Chapter 10."

[Later, when Chapter 10 is written, verify:]
- Does Chapter 10 actually cover RAG implementation?
- Is "RAG implementation" the right term used in Chapter 10?
- Should reference be more specific now that Chapter 10 exists?
```

**Cross-Reference Audit:**

Before publication:
```markdown
## Cross-Reference Verification

Chapter 1 references:
- Chapter 0: 5 backward references ✓ verified
- Chapter 6: 2 forward references ✓ accurate
- Chapter 10: 3 forward references ⚠️ Chapter 10 not yet written (generic refs OK)

Table references:
- All table citations use exact caption names ✓
- All table files exist ✓

Diagram references:
- All diagram numbers sequential ✓
- All diagram files exist ✓
```

### 8.4 Terminology Consistency Across Chapters
**Rule ID:** TCC-INTEG-004  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Source:** TCC-TERM-001 extended to multi-chapter scope

**Rule:** Standard terminology (TCC-TERM-001) must be consistent across ALL chapters, not just within single chapter.

**Global Terminology Lock:**

Once a term is established in Chapter 0 or 1, it becomes the standard for all subsequent chapters.

**Example:**
```markdown
Chapter 0 establishes: "Six Agent Capabilities"

Then ALL chapters use:
✅ "Six Agent Capabilities" 
✅ "the six capabilities"
✅ "these capabilities"

Never:
❌ "Six Agent Requirements"
❌ "the six needs"
❌ "agent prerequisites"
```

**Terminology Evolution:**

**If term needs to change:**

1. **Document the change** in version history
2. **Update all chapters** that use old term
3. **Add to glossary** with note about previous term
4. **Create redirect** in terminology section
```markdown
## Terminology Update Log

**v2.0 (January 2026):**

Changed: "Six Agent Requirements" → "Six Agent Capabilities"

Rationale: "Capabilities" better conveys that these are delivered outcomes, 
not just prerequisites.

Chapters updated: 0, 1, 2, 3

Glossary note: "Six Agent Capabilities (formerly 'Six Agent Requirements' 
in v1.0)"
```

**Chapter-Specific Terminology:**

Some terms are chapter-specific and don't need global consistency:
```markdown
✅ OK to vary:

Chapter 6: "Phase 1: Quick Wins"
Chapter 7: "Step 1: Foundation Building"

Different chapters, different frameworks, no conflict
```

**Glossary Maintenance:**

Maintain master glossary in TCC or book-level README:
```markdown
## Master Terminology Glossary

**Global Terms (use exactly as shown):**
- Agent-Ready Data Architecture: The 7-layer framework (never "agent-ready framework")
- Six Agent Capabilities: The requirements from Chapter 0 (never "six requirements")
- Multi-Agent Orchestration: Coordination of specialist agents (never "agent coordination")

**Chapter-Specific Terms:**
- Phase 1, 2, 3: Used in Chapter 6 (Implementation Roadmap)
- Pillar 1-5: Used in Chapter 2 (Five Pillars)

**Deprecated Terms:**
- "Six Agent Requirements" → Use "Six Agent Capabilities" (changed v2.0)
- "VERT Ethics Audit" in reader-facing content → Use "Independent ethics review"
```
