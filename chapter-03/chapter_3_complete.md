# Chapter 3: The 90-Day Implementation Roadmap
## From Data Chaos to Agent-Ready Infrastructure

**By Ram Katamaraja, CEO, Colaberry Inc.**

---

## Chapter Overview

**Purpose:** Week-by-week implementation guide to build agent-ready data infrastructure in 90 days

**What You'll Learn:**
- Pre-flight readiness assessment (before you start)
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation - governance and storage
- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Intelligence - RAG and orchestration  
- Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Production - observability and launch
- Success metrics tied to INPACTÃ¢â€žÂ¢ + GOALS frameworks

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 0: INPACTÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Framework (understand the six agent needs)
- Chapter 1: 7-Layer Architecture (understand what you're building)
- Chapter 2: GOALS Framework (understand operational targets)

**Supporting Materials:**
- **Appendix A:** Technology Selection Guide (138+ products evaluated)
- **Appendix B:** INPACTÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Framework Reference
- **Appendix C:** GOALS Framework Reference

## Why 90 Days?

Industry data shows 90 days (13 weeks) is optimal for enterprise infrastructure transformation. Combined analysis from ThoughtWorks enterprise projects, McKinsey's State of AI research, and Gartner's pilot success studies reveals a clear pattern [1, 2, 3]:

**Project Duration vs Success Rate:**
- **<60 days:** 28% success rate (rushed, incomplete infrastructure)
- **60-120 days:** 78% success rate (optimal balance of speed and thoroughness)
- **>120 days:** 41% success rate (momentum loss, scope creep, technology drift)

The 90-day window hits the sweet spot: long enough to build production-grade infrastructure, short enough to maintain focus and avoid scope creep.

**Echo Health Systems achieved this in 10 weeks:**
- Investment: $1.23M
- Timeline: 70 days (Weeks 1-10)
- ROI: 477% over 18 months
- Payback: 10 weeks

Their success demonstrates this timeline is achievable even in heavily regulated healthcare environments.

2. Identify 5-8 critical source systems to connect:
   - Healthcare: EHR (Epic/Cerner), lab systems, pharmacy, billing
   - General: CRM (Salesforce), ERP, transactional databases
3. Configure CDC for each source:
   - **Fivetran:** Click "Add Connector" Ã¢â€ â€™ Select source Ã¢â€ â€™ Enter credentials Ã¢â€ â€™ Test Ã¢â€ â€™ Sync
   - **AWS DMS:** Create replication instance Ã¢â€ â€™ Define source/target endpoints Ã¢â€ â€™ Create replication task
   - **Debezium:** Deploy Debezium connector Ã¢â€ â€™ Configure connection Ã¢â€ â€™ Start streaming
4. Define CDC strategy:
   - **Full load + incremental:** Initial snapshot, then capture changes (recommended)
   - **Incremental only:** Capture only new changes (if historical data already loaded)
5. Test CDC:
   - Make a change in source system (e.g., update patient record)
   - Verify change appears in target within 5 minutes
6. Monitor CDC latency

**Deliverable:** CDC operational, capturing changes from 5-8 sources

---

### Day 2-3: Event Streaming Deployment

1. Provision event streaming platform (Confluent Cloud, Azure Event Hubs, Kinesis, or Kafka OSS)
2. Configure security:
   - Enable encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Configure SASL/SCRAM authentication or managed identities
3. Create topics (10-20 topics):
   - Healthcare examples: `patient_updates`, `lab_results`, `prescriptions`, `encounters`
   - General examples: `customer_updates`, `appointments`, `encounters`, `events`
4. Configure retention:
   - Critical data: 7-30 days retention
   - Analytics: 90-365 days retention (or infinite with tiered storage)
5. Set up producers:
   - CDC Ã¢â€ â€™ Stream (Fivetran writes to Kafka, or configure DMS Ã¢â€ â€™ Kinesis)
6. Set up consumers:
   - Stream Ã¢â€ â€™ Vector DB (real-time embedding updates)
   - Stream Ã¢â€ â€™ Warehouse (real-time fact table updates)
7. Test end-to-end flow:
   - Update source record Ã¢â€ â€™ CDC captures Ã¢â€ â€™ Stream publishes Ã¢â€ â€™ Consumers process Ã¢â€ â€™ Verify in vector DB and warehouse

**Deliverable:** Event streaming operational, end-to-end flow tested

     - Consume events from stream
     - Transform to warehouse schema
     - Upsert to warehouse (merge/upsert pattern)
     - Target latency: <15 minutes end-to-end
2. Implement error handling:
   - Dead-letter queue (DLQ) for failed messages
   - Retry logic (exponential backoff)
   - Alerting on high error rates (>1%)
3. Test data freshness:
   - Update source record
   - Measure time until visible in vector DB: [X minutes]
   - Measure time until visible in warehouse: [Y minutes]
   - Target: 95% of updates <1 hour
4. Optimize throughput:

1. Sign up for LLM provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Anthropic)
2. Request HIPAA BAA (if healthcare) - typically 1-2 week lead time, do this early!
3. Create API keys
4. Store API keys in secrets management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager from Week 1)
5. Test API:
   ```python
   from openai import OpenAI
   patient = OpenAI(api_key=get_secret("openai_api_key"))
   
   response = patient.chat.completions.create(
       model="gpt-4o",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
   )
   print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   ```
6. Measure baseline latency (should be <2s for simple queries)

**Deliverable:** LLM API operational, test queries working

---

### Day 2: Embedding Model Deployment

**Activities:**
1. Deploy embedding model (same provider as LLM, or separate)
2. Test embedding generation:
   ```python
   response = patient.embeddings.create(
       model="text-embedding-3-large",
       input="Patient presents with chest pain"
   )
   embedding = response.data[0].embedding  # 3072-dim vector
   ```
3. Benchmark embedding latency (target <500ms)
4. Generate embeddings for sample data (1K-10K documents)
5. Store in vector DB (from Week 2)
6. Test similarity search:
   ```python
   # Query vector DB
   results = vector_db.search(
       query_embedding=embedding,
       top_k=10,
       filters={"classification": "PHI", "department": "cardiology"}
   )
   ```

**Deliverable:** Embedding model operational, vector search working

---

### Day 3-4: Basic Agent Framework

**Activities:**
1. Install LangChain (or chosen framework):
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-openai --break-system-packages
   ```
2. Create basic agent:
   ```python
   from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
   
   llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
   
   prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
       ("system", "You are a helpful healthcare assistant."),
       ("human", "{input}"),
       ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}")
   ])
   
   agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)
   ```
3. Connect agent to semantic layer (Week 3 dbt models):
   - Create "Query Semantic Layer" tool
   - Agent can ask questions like "What is our average length of stay?"
   - Tool executes SQL against warehouse, returns result
4. Test agent queries:
   - "How many active patients do we have?"
   - "What's the average HbA1c for diabetic patients?"
   - "List the top 5 providers by patient volume"

**Deliverable:** Basic agent answering questions using semantic layer

---

### Day 5: Audit Logging for LLM Calls

**Activities:**
1. Create LLM audit schema (add to Week 1 audit logging):
   - trace_id (string) - for correlating LLM calls
   - user_id (string) - who made request
   - timestamp (datetime)
   - model (string) - e.g., "gpt-4o"
   - prompt (text) - user input (truncated if >1K chars)
   - response (text) - LLM output (truncated if >1K chars)
   - tokens_used (int) - prompt + completion tokens
   - latency_ms (int)
   - cost_usd (float) - calculated from tokens
   - function_calls (json) - if agent used tools
2. Implement audit logging wrapper:
   ```python
   def audit_llm_call(func):
       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
           start = time.time()
           response = func(*args, **kwargs)
           latency = (time.time() - start) * 1000
           
           audit_log.write({
               "trace_id": get_trace_id(),
               "user_id": get_user_id(),
               "model": kwargs.get("model"),
               "prompt": kwargs.get("messages")[-1]["content"],
               "response": response.choices[0].message.content,
               "tokens": response.usage.total_tokens,
               "latency_ms": latency,
               "cost_usd": calculate_cost(response.usage, kwargs.get("model"))
           })
           return response
       return wrapper
   ```
3. Test audit logs (verify all LLM calls captured)

## Week 6 Implementation Guide

### Day 1-2: Hybrid Search Implementation

**Activities:**
1. Enhance vector search with keyword search:
   - **Vector search:** Find semantically similar chunks
   - **Keyword search (BM25):** Find exact keyword matches
   - **Hybrid:** Combine both with weighted scoring
2. Implement hybrid search:
   ```python
   def hybrid_search(query, top_k=20, alpha=0.7):
       # alpha controls vector vs keyword weight (0.7 = 70% vector, 30% keyword)
       
       # Vector search
       query_embedding = embed(query)
       vector_results = vector_db.search(query_embedding, top_k=top_k)
       
       # Keyword search (BM25 on same corpus)
       keyword_results = bm25_search(query, top_k=top_k)
       
       # Combine with weighted scoring
       combined = merge_results(
           vector_results, 
           keyword_results, 
           alpha=alpha
       )
       
       return combined[:top_k]
   ```
3. Tune alpha parameter:
   - Test queries on eval set (50-100 queries)
   - Measure NDCG@5 for different alpha values (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)
   - Select best alpha (typically 0.6-0.8)
4. Benchmark hybrid vs pure vector:
   - Hybrid search should improve NDCG by 15-25% [7]

**Deliverable:** Hybrid search operational, tuned alpha parameter

---

### Day 2-3: Reranker Deployment

**Activities:**
1. Deploy reranker (Cohere Rerank or cross-encoder)
2. Integrate into RAG pipeline:
   ```python
   def rag_retrieve(query, top_k=5):
       # Step 1: Hybrid search (retrieve top 20)
       candidates = hybrid_search(query, top_k=20)
       
       # Step 2: Rerank (narrow to top 5)
       reranked = cohere_rerank(
           query=query,
           documents=[c["text"] for c in candidates],
           top_k=top_k
       )
       
       # Step 3: Return top k reranked results
       return [candidates[i] for i in reranked["indices"][:top_k]]
   ```
3. Benchmark reranker impact:
   - Without reranking: NDCG@5 = [X] (baseline ~0.71)
   - With reranking: NDCG@5 = [Y] (target ~0.89, +25% improvement) [18]
4. Optimize reranker:
   - Latency: Reranker adds 50-100ms (acceptable for +25% precision)
   - Cost: $2/1K searches Ã¢â€°Ë† $0.002/query (negligible)

**Deliverable:** Reranker operational, NDCG improved by 20-25%

---

### Day 3-4: Context Assembly & Token Management

**Activities:**
1. Implement context assembly:
   ```python
   def assemble_context(query, top_k=5, max_tokens=4000):
       # Retrieve relevant chunks
       chunks = rag_retrieve(query, top_k=top_k)
       
       # Assemble context (respecting token limit)
       context_parts = []
       token_count = 0
       
       for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
           chunk_tokens = count_tokens(chunk["text"])
           if token_count + chunk_tokens > max_tokens:
               break  # Stop before exceeding limit
           
           context_parts.append(f"[Source {i+1}] {chunk['text']}")
           token_count += chunk_tokens
       
       context = "\n\n".join(context_parts)
       
       # Add metadata (for citations)
       metadata = [
           {
               "source_id": chunk["doc_id"],
               "chunk_index": chunk["chunk_index"],
               "relevance_score": chunk["score"]
           }
           for chunk in chunks[:len(context_parts)]
       ]
       
       return context, metadata
   ```
2. Test token management:
   - Verify context never exceeds model's context window (e.g., 128K for GPT-4o)
   - Leave room for prompt + response (if 128K total, use max 100K for context)
3. Implement truncation strategy:
   - **Option A:** Include top-k chunks that fit in token budget
   - **Option B:** Summarize chunks if too long (use LLM to compress)
   - Recommended: Option A (simpler, faster)

**Deliverable:** Context assembly respecting token limits

### Day 4-5: RAG Quality Evaluation

**Activities:**
1. Create evaluation dataset:
   - 50-100 questions with ground truth answers
   - Healthcare examples:
     - "What's the protocol for sepsis management?" Ã¢â€ â€™ [Expected: specific protocol from knowledge base]
     - "What's the average HbA1c for diabetic patients?" Ã¢â€ â€™ [Expected: 7.2%]
   - Cover diverse question types (factual, procedural, analytical)
2. Evaluate RAG pipeline:
   ```python
   def evaluate_rag(eval_dataset):
       results = []
       for question, ground_truth in eval_dataset:
           # Generate answer using RAG
           context, metadata = assemble_context(question)
           answer = agent_answer(question, context)
           
           # Measure accuracy
           correct = is_correct(answer, ground_truth)  # Manual or LLM-as-judge
           
           results.append({
               "question": question,
               "answer": answer,
               "ground_truth": ground_truth,
               "correct": correct,
               "sources": metadata
           })
       
       accuracy = sum(r["correct"] for r in results) / len(results)
       return accuracy, results
   ```
3. Target accuracy: 85%+ (vs 75% Week 5 baseline)
4. Analyze failures:
   - Which questions failed? Why?
   - Common failure modes: retrieval failures, reasoning errors, hallucinations
5. Iterate on prompts/retrieval if needed

**Deliverable:** RAG evaluation showing 85%+ accuracy

### Incident Response Runbook

**Severity Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Service down, data breach, HIPAA violation Ã¢â€ â€™ Page on-call immediately
- **P1 (High):** Degraded performance, high error rate (>10%) Ã¢â€ â€™ Alert during business hours
- **P2 (Medium):** Minor issues, low error rate (5-10%) Ã¢â€ â€™ Weekly review
- **P3 (Low):** Cosmetic issues, feature requests Ã¢â€ â€™ Backlog

**P0 Incident Response (Critical):**
1. **Detect:** Alert fires (APM, monitoring)
2. **Triage:** On-call engineer assesses severity (is this really P0?)
3. **Mitigate:** Take immediate action to restore service:
   - If LLM outage: Failover to backup provider
   - If database outage: Failover to replica
   - If security breach: Isolate affected systems
4. **Communicate:** Update status page, notify stakeholders
5. **Resolve:** Fix root cause
6. **Post-Mortem:** Within 48 hours, document what happened, why, and how to prevent

**Example P0 Scenarios:**
- **LLM API outage:** Failover to Claude (if OpenAI down) or show maintenance page
- **Data breach:** Isolate systems, notify security team, follow HIPAA breach protocol
- **ABAC failure (all requests denied):** Rollback to last known good config

---

### Continuous Improvement Framework

**Goal:** Improve agents 1-2% per week through systematic iteration

**Weekly Improvement Cycle:**
1. **Monday:** Review last week's metrics (accuracy, latency, cost)
2. **Tuesday:** Analyze failures (which queries failed? why?)
3. **Wednesday:** Propose improvements (new data sources, prompt changes, model upgrades)
4. **Thursday:** Implement improvements (A/B test if possible)
5. **Friday:** Measure impact (did accuracy improve? did cost decrease?)

**Improvement Ideas:**
- Add more documents to vector DB (expand knowledge base)
- Fine-tune prompts (improve clarity, reduce hallucinations)
- Upgrade models (GPT-4o Ã¢â€ â€™ GPT-4.5 when available)
- Optimize caching (improve hit rate 60% Ã¢â€ â€™ 75%)
- Add more agents (specialize further)
