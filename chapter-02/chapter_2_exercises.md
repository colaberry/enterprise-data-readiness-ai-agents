## Exercise 3: Map Your Failure Cascade Risks
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Challenging  
**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Uses:** Diagram 11 (Failure Cascade)  
**Deliverable:** Your organization's specific failure cascade scenarios

### Objective
Identify how YOUR organization's weak pillars could compound into catastrophic failures‚Äîand create mitigation plans.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Identify Your Weakest Pillars (10 minutes)**

From Exercise 1, list pillars scoring <60%:

1. Pillar: ____________ | Score: ___% | Status: ___
2. Pillar: ____________ | Score: ___% | Status: ___
3. Pillar: ____________ | Score: ___% | Status: ___

**Step 2: Map Cascade Scenario 1 (25 minutes)**

Using Diagram 11 as a template, map a specific failure cascade for YOUR organization:

**Starting Condition:**
- Weak Pillar(s): [List 2-3 weak pillars]
- Planned Agent Use Case: [Describe your first planned agent]
  - Example: "Customer service agent to answer product questions"

**Cascade Step 1:**
- **Trigger:** [What initial failure could occur?]
  - Example: "No observability monitoring"
- **Impact:** [What goes undetected?]
  - Example: "Data from product catalog becomes stale (updated in vendor system but not in our warehouse)"

**Cascade Step 2:**
- **Compounding Failure:** [How does Step 1 enable Step 2?]
  - Example: "Stale product data (prices, availability) goes undetected for 8 hours"
- **Impact:** [What breaks next?]
  - Example: "Agent gives customers wrong prices and says products are in stock when they're not"

**Cascade Step 3:**
- **Compounding Failure:** [How do Steps 1-2 enable Step 3?]
  - Example: "No semantic validation (Pillar 2 weak) means agent doesn't catch nonsensical inventory levels"
- **Impact:** [What fails next?]
  - Example: "Agent tells customer 'Yes, we have 10,000 units' when product is discontinued"

**Cascade Step 4:**
- **Compounding Failure:** [How do Steps 1-3 enable Step 4?]
  - Example: "No governance controls (Pillar 4 weak) means agent accesses pricing data it shouldn't"
- **Impact:** [What privacy/security breach occurs?]
  - Example: "Agent shows wholesale pricing to retail customers, violating vendor agreements"

**Final Outcome:**
- **User Impact:** [What do customers/users experience?]
  - Example: "Customers place orders for wrong prices, orders fail, trust lost"
- **Business Impact:** [What's the cost?]
  - Example: "$200K in pricing errors, vendor contract breach ($50K penalty), 1,000 customer complaints, agent taken offline"
- **Total Estimated Impact:** $______

**Step 3: Map Prevention Strategy (15 minutes)**

For the same scenario, identify which strong pillars would prevent the cascade:

**Prevention Point 1:**
- **Strong Pillar:** [Which pillar, if strong, would catch this?]
  - Example: "Observability (Pillar 5) at >80%"
- **How it prevents:** [Specific mechanism]
  - Example: "Real-time data freshness monitoring detects stale catalog in 10 minutes, alerts team before agent uses bad data"

**Prevention Point 2:**
- **Strong Pillar:** [Which pillar provides safety net?]
  - Example: "Quality & Trust (Pillar 3) at >80%"
- **How it prevents:** [Specific mechanism]
  - Example: "Automated validation rules reject inventory values >1000 units without manual approval"

**Prevention Point 3:**
- **Strong Pillar:** [Which pillar provides final backstop?]
  - Example: "Governance (Pillar 4) at >80%"
- **How it prevents:** [Specific mechanism]
  - Example: "ABAC policies prevent agent from accessing wholesale pricing table, only allows retail pricing"

**Step 4: Map Cascade Scenario 2 (Optional, 25 minutes)**

If you have multiple weak pillars, repeat Steps 2-3 for a different agent use case.

**Step 5: Create Risk Mitigation Plan (15 minutes)**

Based on your cascade scenarios, create a risk mitigation plan:

```
RISK MITIGATION PLAN

HIGHEST RISK SCENARIO: [Brief description]
Estimated Impact: $______
Probability: [ ] High [ ] Medium [ ] Low

MITIGATION ACTIONS (In Priority Order):

1. Strengthen [Pillar Name] to >60%

   - Risk reduction: [High/Medium/Low]

3. Add Safety Net: [Specific control]
   - Description: ___________________________________
   - Timeline: ___ weeks
   - Cost: $______
   - Risk reduction: [High/Medium/Low]

TOTAL MITIGATION COST: $______
TOTAL RISK AVOIDED: $______
ROI: ___% (Risk Avoided / Mitigation Cost)

DEPLOYMENT DECISION:
[ ] Proceed with agent deployment now (risk acceptable)
[ ] Delay deployment until Priority 1-2 mitigations complete
[ ] Delay deployment until all mitigations complete
```

### Reflection Questions

1. **Surprise:** Were you surprised by how quickly weak pillars could cascade into major failures?

2. **Hidden Costs:** What's the ratio of "prevention cost" to "failure cost"?
   - Prevention: $______ (mitigation actions)
   - Failure: $______ (total cascade impact)
   - Ratio: ____:1 (e.g., "1:10 = $1 prevention saves $10 in failures")

3. **Executive Communication:** If you had to explain ONE cascade scenario to your CEO in 60 seconds, which would you choose and why?

4. **Quick Wins:** Are there any "low-cost, high-impact" mitigations that could break multiple cascades?

### Deliverable

**Save your cascade maps as:** `[YourCompany]_Risk_Cascade_Analysis_[Date].pdf`

**Use for:**
- Budget justification (show ROI of prevention)
- Executive risk communication
- Team alignment (make risks concrete)
- Agent deployment go/no-go decisions

**What's the minimum score needed to balance?**
- Target: Bring all pillars within 20% of each other
- Lowest pillar must reach: ___% (highest - 20%)
- Example: If highest = 80%, lowest must reach 60%

**Balance Improvement Actions:**

For each low pillar, pick ONE quick win action:

**Pillar 1: [Name]**
- Current: ___%
- Target: ___%
- Quick win action: ___________________________________
- Timeline: ___ weeks

**Pillar 2: [Name]**

### Reflection Questions

1. **Feasibility:** Is your timeline realistic given current team capacity and budget?

2. **Dependencies:** What external dependencies could delay your timeline? (vendor selection, budget approval, hiring)

3. **Flexibility:** If a phase takes 2 weeks longer than planned, how does that cascade through the remaining phases?

4. **Success Criteria:** How will you know if Phase 1 was successful? (Be specific with metrics)

### Deliverable
