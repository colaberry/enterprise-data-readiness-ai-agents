# The 6 Agent Needs: Why 95% of AI Pilots Fail — and How to Build Agents Users Trust

## The $40 Billion Trust Paradox

A July 2025 MIT study from Project NANDA examined 300+ enterprise GenAI initiatives across 52 organizations (with surveys from 153 senior leaders). The finding: 95% of organizations report failing to achieve meaningful ROI from their GenAI investments. ([MIT NANDA Study, July 2025](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf)) ¹

Here's what's puzzling: AI agents are more accurate than ever. Models like Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4 achieve superhuman performance on many tasks. Yet pilots keep failing.

**The answer lies in trust, not technology.**

Users abandon agents they can't understand—regardless of technical sophistication. July 2025 research confirms what practitioners already know: transparency and design are the mediators of trust. ([ScienceDirect, July 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X25001155)) ² When users can't see how agents make decisions, research shows distrust commonly spreads to both the AI and the company behind it. ([Nature, July 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05116-z)) ³ Technical excellence means nothing without earned trust.

This trust deficit shows up across the industry:

- **Gartner (July 2024):** 30% of GenAI projects expected to be abandoned after proof of concept by end of 2025 ([Gartner, July 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-29-gartner-predicts-30-percent-of-generative-ai-projects-will-be-abandoned-after-proof-of-concept-by-end-of-2025)) ⁴ᵃ
- **Gartner (May 2025):** Updated prediction shows at least 50% of GenAI projects expected to be abandoned through 2025 — deterioration accelerating ([Gartner, May 2025](https://www.node-magazine.com/thoughtleadership/gartner-why-generative-ai-projects-fail-and-how-to-turn-the-tide)) ⁴ᵇ
- **McKinsey (March 2025):** More than 80% of organizations aren't seeing a tangible impact on enterprise-level EBIT from GenAI ([McKinsey, March 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)) ⁵

Combined investment? $30-40 billion. Combined results? A widening divide between the few who succeed and the many who don't.

**The problem isn't the models. It's the architecture. And the architecture's fundamental flaw? It doesn't build trust.**

## The Solution: INPACT™ — Six Needs That Build Trust

Ram Katamaraja and Colaberry have identified a pattern through analysis of extensive research and deployments across industries: **agents that earn trust fulfill six specific architectural needs. Agents that fail commonly neglect at least one.**

This discovery led to **INPACT™** — the framework that separates the 5% who succeed from the 95% who fail.

## The Tony Robbins Parallel

Tony Robbins built an empire on one insight: humans have six core needs - certainty, variety, significance, connection, growth, and contribution. ([Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/mind-meaning/do-you-need-to-feel-significant/)) ⁶

When these needs are fulfilled, humans flourish. When they're not, people stagnate.

AI agents are no different.

They don't need psychological fulfillment. They need architectural fulfillment. And when their six needs go unmet, they fail at the same 95% rate.

This is the **INPACT™ Framework**: the six agent needs that separate success from failure.

## Trust is the Outcome - INPACT™ Delivers It

Ask any CDO deploying agents: "What's your biggest concern?"

"Will users trust it?"

Trust isn't optional. It's the line separating the 5% who succeed from the 95% who fail. But trust isn't something you declare—it's something you earn through architecture that consistently delivers six essential capabilities.

That's INPACT™: the framework for building agents users trust.

The acronym is **INPACT™** (sounds like "impact"), and every letter represents an essential need:

- **I** - Instant (sub-second responses)
- **N** - Natural (language understanding)
- **P** - Permitted (dynamic authorization)
- **A** - Adaptive (continuous learning)
- **C** - Contextual (complete cross-system data)
- **T** - Trusted (transparency through audit trails)

**Mnemonic:** "Agents must be **I**nstant, **N**atural, **P**ermitted, **A**daptive, **C**ontextual, and **T**rusted—addressing each need systematically to earn trust consistently."

All six needs are required. Analysis suggests that addressing all six needs systematically is associated with higher success rates in building agents users trust. Organizations that miss even one face significantly higher risk of joining the 95% who fail.

## I - Instant: Speed Builds Confidence

Your enterprise data systems were built for patience. Overnight batch jobs. Queries that take 9-13 seconds. Data that's hours or days old.

That worked when humans analyzed reports over coffee. It fails when agents must respond at conversation speed.

**The speed imperative is clear:**
- **90% of customers expect instant responses** when reaching out with service queries ([HubSpot, 2024 State of Service](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/state-of-service-report)) ⁷ᵃ
- **61% prefer faster replies from AI over waiting for a human** — speed now trumps human interaction ([Intercom, 2024](https://downloads.ctfassets.net/xny2w179f4ki/3FxNFG5dIUBgphM6xqLgPy/ecfaca62ff0550e4d345b31addbff762/Intercom_Customer_Service_Trends_Report_2024.pdf)) ⁷ᵇ
- **60% define "immediate" as 10 minutes or less** ([HubSpot, 2024 State of Service](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/state-of-service-report)) ⁷ᵃ

Every second of latency costs trust. When a patient calls to schedule an appointment, the agent queries last night's data dump. The cancellation that happened 30 seconds ago? Invisible. The agent books a slot that's already gone. The patient calls back, frustrated. Trust evaporates.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Real-time data streams. Sub-second queries. Information never more than 30 seconds old.

**Target SLOs:**

- **Agent response time:** <2 seconds for single queries, <3 seconds when coordinating multiple specialists
- **Data freshness:** <30 seconds for critical sources (appointments, inventory, eligibility)
- **Infrastructure performance:** Database queries <200ms, LLM inference 300-500ms

Conversations flow. Trust builds with every accurate, instant response.

## N - Natural: Understanding Builds Connection

A care coordinator asks: *"Show me patients needing diabetes follow-up this quarter."*

Your agent thinks: *"What is table FCT_PTNT_ENCT?"*

**Baseline Performance:**
Text-to-SQL accuracy on academic benchmarks like Spider: 60-70%. ([Spider Benchmark](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider)) ⁸ But enterprise schemas with hundreds of cryptically-named tables dramatically increase difficulty—many organizations see 40-60% accuracy in early testing without optimization.

**Target SLO with Semantic Optimization:**
With semantic layer implementation, accuracy improves to 75-85%+. ([Databricks, 2024](https://www.databricks.com/blog/improving-text2sql-performance-ease-databricks)) ⁹ However, most enterprises haven't invested in that infrastructure.

Your data warehouse has 487 tables with names like `FCT_PTNT_ENCT` and `DIM_PRVDR_SPCLT`. Documentation is 18 months out of date. The three engineers who understand it are in back-to-back meetings. Agents don't have tribal knowledge. They can't guess. Four out of ten queries fail silently, returning nothing or—worse—returning the wrong patients.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Semantic layers map natural language to data automatically. Business glossaries define terms once. "Diabetes follow-up" connects to diagnosis codes, HbA1c thresholds, and scheduling logic instantly. With semantic optimization, accuracy reaches the 85%+ target range. Conversations become natural. Coordinators ask questions; agents understand.

## P - Permitted: Security Builds Safety

One agent. Three users. Three completely different permission requirements.

A physician asks: "Show me today's patient appointments." They should see all 200 appointments across the clinic.

A patient asks: "Show me my appointments." They should see only their own.

An administrator asks: "Show me appointment statistics." They should see aggregate numbers, not individual patient names.

The agent needs to enforce the right permissions in milliseconds, every single time—or you're facing HIPAA violations.

Your current approach doesn't work. Most organizations give the agent a single "service account" with broad database permissions, then add custom code to filter results. This creates two critical problems:

First, **compliance violations.** HIPAA and GDPR require dynamic access control with audit trails showing who accessed what data, when, and why. ([HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.312)) ¹⁰ A service account accessing everything on behalf of different users doesn't meet this standard. When auditors ask "Who saw patient 12345's records?", you can't answer.

Second, **it doesn't scale.** Adding role-based rules for every combination creates what NIST calls "role explosion." ([NIST SP 800-162](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-162.pdf)) ¹¹ A system with just 10 attributes requires over 1,000 roles. Developers spend more time managing permission logic than building features.

Modern attribute-based access control (ABAC) solves this by evaluating permissions dynamically in real-time. As Rippling's 2025 analysis explains, ABAC is particularly well-suited for dynamic environments where user responsibilities and resource classifications frequently change, providing the flexibility and fine-grained control that static RBAC cannot deliver. ([Rippling, April 2025](https://www.rippling.com/blog/attribute-based-access-control)) ¹¹ᵇ

Your pilot agent uses one service account. A patient asks about their records. The agent queries the database successfully—but the audit log shows `service_account accessed patient_table at 14:32:18`. No user identity. No purpose. No data returned. When the breach happens (and it will), you can't prove who accessed what. HIPAA fines start at $50,000 per violation.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Dynamic access control evaluates permissions in real-time based on who's asking, what they're accessing, when, where, and why.

**Target SLO:**
- **Authorization evaluation:** <10 milliseconds per query

Every access is audited with full provenance: user identity, accessed resources, applied policies, and business justification. This satisfies both HIPAA's audit requirements and GDPR's right to explanation.

Physicians see everything in their scope. Patients see only their data. Administrators see aggregates. Every query is audited with complete context. Compliance becomes automatic.

## A - Adaptive: Learning Builds Accuracy

Your agent gave accurate answers for three months. Then accuracy degraded. Users noticed. Trust evaporated.

The culprit: Your embedding model was trained six months ago. Medical terminology evolved—new drug names, new procedure codes, new treatment protocols. The model didn't.

ML model degradation is well-documented: a 2024 multi-university study found ~91% of models degrade over time, including the embedding models agents rely on for semantic search. ([NannyML, 2024](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/91-of-ml-perfomance-degrade-in-time)) ¹² For language models specifically, practitioners report error rates jumping ~35% on new data after 6+ months without retraining. ([Rohan Paul, June 2025](https://www.rohan-paul.com/p/ml-interview-q-series-handling-llm)) ¹³ᵃ In agent systems, this commonly manifests as declining retrieval quality: medical terminology evolves, new product names emerge, and embedding models trained six months ago can't recognize them.

The solution requires proactive infrastructure design. As NexaStack's 2025 analysis emphasizes, organizations must shift from reactive monitoring to anticipatory systems that detect, mitigate, and adapt to drift in real-time through continuous monitoring, automated pipelines, and adaptive governance integrated into the architecture itself. ([NexaStack, July 2025](https://www.nexastack.ai/blog/model-drift-infrastructure-design)) ¹³ᵇ

January: Your agent achieves 94% retrieval accuracy. Physicians love it.  
March: New diabetes medication "Rybelsus" enters the formulary. The embedding model doesn't recognize it. Queries about "newest diabetes drugs" miss it entirely.  
June: Retrieval accuracy has dropped to 78%. Physicians stop trusting the agent. They go back to calling the pharmacy directly.

Your quarterly reviews discover the problem in September—six months after users noticed. By then, trust is gone.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Continuous monitoring tracks retrieval quality in real-time. Drift detection triggers retraining within days, not months. A/B testing validates improvements before full deployment. The agent gets smarter over time instead of dumber. Accuracy improves. Trust compounds.

## C - Contextual: Completeness Builds Reliability

*"Am I eligible for the diabetes program?"*

Simple question. Complex answer. The information needed lives in five different systems:

- **EHR:** Diagnosis codes, lab results
- **Claims:** Coverage, authorizations
- **Portal:** Engagement history
- **Care Management:** Current enrollments
- **Provider Notes:** Clinical observations

No single system has the answer. And assembling data from multiple sources isn't enough—the context must also be **Instant** (fresh), **Natural** (semantically unified), **Permitted** (properly authorized), **Adaptive** (quality-monitored), and **Trusted** (fully traceable).

Your current approach: manual integration. Each connection takes 6-8 weeks. By the time you connect five systems (12 weeks), requirements have changed. Even when connected, the data is often stale, inconsistent, ungoverned, unmonitored, and untraceable.

The impact is severe: Gartner predicts that a lack of quality data—including incomplete context—will kill more than 40% of agentic AI projects by the end of 2027. ([Gartner, June 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027)) ¹⁴ In multi-agent systems, the stakes are higher: if even one agent operates on incomplete or lagging data, the entire system is associated with producing misaligned, conflicting, or incomplete answers that erode user trust.

Your pilot agent queries the EHR: Diagnosis confirms diabetes. Queries the claims system: Timeout after 8 seconds. The agent can't wait—it has a 2-second response target. It answers based on incomplete data: "You're eligible."

But the claims system (when it finally responds) shows: Prior authorization denied. Patient calls to enroll. Enrollment team says: "Your insurance doesn't cover this." Patient is confused and angry. Agent credibility: destroyed.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Real-time data fabric unifies all sources with proper governance. The agent assembles complete, fresh, authorized, quality-checked, and traceable context from 5+ systems through:

**Target SLO:**
- **Cross-system query assembly:** <2 seconds for 5+ source systems

**Key capabilities:**
- **Entity resolution:** Connecting patient/member/customer identities across systems despite different IDs, name variations, or data inconsistencies
- **Policy-aware retrieval:** Each data access respects the user's permissions and organizational policies in real-time
- **Semantic unification:** Mapping terminology across systems (e.g., 'member' in claims = 'patient' in EHR = 'subscriber' in eligibility)

Nothing is missing. Nothing is wrong. Answers are complete. Decisions are sound. Trust is earned.

## T - Trusted: Transparency Builds Trust

Your agent recommends against program enrollment. The coordinator disagrees and asks: *"How did the agent decide that?"*

Your logs show: `service_account accessed patient_eligibility_table at 14:32:18`

That's all. No user identity. No data retrieved. No decision logic. No explanation. You can't answer. Trust is destroyed.

July 2025 research confirms: transparency and effective design serve as crucial mediators for building trust in AI-powered digital agents. ([ScienceDirect, July 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X25001155)) ¹⁶ When users can't understand how agents make decisions, distrust commonly spreads to both the AI and the company deploying it. Technical excellence means nothing without transparency.

The regulatory stakes are equally high:

- **HIPAA** requires audit logs for 6 years. Penalties for willful neglect: up to $50,000 per violation, with annual caps of $1.5M per violation category—but major breaches often result in multi-million dollar settlements. ([HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.312)) ¹⁷
- **GDPR** Article 22 mandates the right to explanation for automated decision-making. Fines: up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher. ([GDPR Article 22](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/)) ¹⁸

A patient disputes an eligibility decision. Your compliance officer asks for the audit trail. You provide: Agent ID, timestamp, table accessed. That's it.

The officer asks: "Which user initiated this? What data did the agent retrieve? Which policy was applied? Why was the patient deemed ineligible?"

You can't answer any of these questions. The audit trail is incomplete. HIPAA requires complete access logs. You're non-compliant. The breach investigation escalates. Penalties accumulate.

**When this need is fulfilled:** Every query gets a unique trace ID. Every data access is logged with complete context:

**Audit Trail Components:**
- **Who:** User identity and role
- **What:** Specific data accessed (table, fields, record IDs)
- **When:** Precise timestamp
- **Where:** System, application, and geographic context
- **Why:** Business purpose and policy applied
- **Result:** Data returned and decision outcome

In user-facing answers, provenance links (showing sources and trace IDs) are displayed by default, enabling users to verify agent reasoning and follow the decision trail immediately.

Audit logs are immutable and tamper-evident. Every answer cites sources with provenance links for transparency. Questions like "How did you decide?" get answered in minutes, not days. Compliance becomes automatic. Trust becomes earned, not assumed.

## The Human ↔ Agent Parallel

Tony Robbins discovered that humans reach their highest potential when their six needs are fulfilled. ([Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/mind-meaning/do-you-need-to-feel-significant/)) ⁶ The same principle applies to agents—but their needs are architectural, not psychological.

Both systems share one truth: **fulfillment unlocks potential.**

The parallel isn't one-to-one (CERTAINTY doesn't map directly to INSTANT, CONNECTION doesn't map to CONTEXTUAL). It's structural: both are systems that either fulfill their foundational requirements or fail.

- **Humans with unmet needs:** Stagnate, struggle, withdraw
- **Agents with unmet needs:** Fail pilots, erode trust, get abandoned
- **Humans with fulfilled needs:** Flourish, contribute, grow
- **Agents with fulfilled needs:** Earn trust, deliver value, improve

**Robbins' insight:** Identify the needs, fulfill them, unlock potential.  
**INPACT™'s insight:** Identify the needs, fulfill them, unlock trust.

Same principle. Different needs. Same outcome: transformation.

## Why 95% Fail: The Pattern

The pattern is consistent. Failed pilots commonly trace back to one or more unmet needs:

|Unmet Need    |What Happens      |Result               |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
|**Instant**   |9-13 second waits |Users abandon        |
|**Natural**   |40-60% accuracy   |Trust erodes         |
|**Permitted** |Static permissions|Compliance violations|
|**Adaptive**  |Degrading quality |Silent failures      |
|**Contextual**|Partial answers   |Wrong decisions      |
|**Trusted**   |No audit trail    |Enterprise rejection |

Most failures trace back to three or four unmet needs. The successful minority addresses all six needs systematically. This pattern appears across industries and use cases.

## The Path Forward

These needs are achievable. Industry analysis reveals that organizations crossing the divide share common patterns.

Not by buying better models. By building architecture that addresses what research suggests agents require.

**The INPACT™ Stack:**

|Need          |Infrastructure Required                  |**What This Enables**                    |Priority    |Timeline†   |Complexity|
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|
|**Instant**   |Real-time data fabric (CDC, streaming)   |Conversations flow naturally; users never wait for stale data|High|3-4 weeks|Medium|
|**Natural**   |Semantic layer (glossary, ontologies)    |Business users ask questions in plain language; agents understand context|High|4-6 weeks|High|
|**Permitted** |ABAC governance (dynamic policies)       |Security is automatic and auditable; compliance is built-in|**Critical**|2-3 weeks|Low|
|**Adaptive**  |Continuous monitoring (drift detection)  |Quality improves over time instead of degrading|Medium|2-4 weeks|Medium|
|**Contextual**|Cross-domain integration (unified fabric)|Answers are complete and accurate across all relevant systems|High|5-8 weeks|High|
|**Trusted**   |Complete audit trails (immutable logs)   |Every decision is explainable; regulatory compliance is provable|**Critical**|1-2 weeks|Low|

† Timeline targets; actual duration varies based on organizational starting point and implementation approach

**Implementation Strategy:**

Start with **Permitted** and **Trusted** (Weeks 1-3): Build the foundational security and compliance layer. This is non-negotiable and fast to implement with existing cloud tools.

Then **Instant** (Weeks 4-7): Add real-time data fabric for critical data sources. Start with the 3-5 tables your pilot agent will query most.

Then **Natural** (Weeks 8-13): Build semantic layer for those same critical tables. Map natural language to your data.

Then **Contextual** (Weeks 14-21): Integrate additional data sources. Expand cross-domain context.

Finally **Adaptive** (Weeks 22-25): Add monitoring and drift detection. This matters most after you have production traffic.

**Target Timeline: 90 days to INPACT™ readiness.**

These capabilities can be implemented with cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud), managed agent services (Copilot, Q Business, watsonx), or custom architectures—depending on your requirements and constraints.

-----

## Quick Win: First Agent in 3 Weeks

Don't want to wait 90 days to see results?

**Start with Permitted + Trusted (Weeks 1-3):**

Using cloud-native tools (Azure Policy, AWS Verified Permissions, Google Cloud IAM), you can implement:

- ✅ ABAC governance with dynamic access control
- ✅ Immutable audit logging with trace IDs
- ✅ Basic agent with proper permissions and full transparency

**What this unlocks:**

- A working, compliant agent deployed in production
- Compliance officer approval (you're HIPAA/GDPR-ready)
- Organizational confidence (quick win builds momentum)
- Foundation for layering in the other 4 needs

**Then scale (Weeks 4-12):**

- Add **Instant** (real-time data fabric)
- Add **Natural** (semantic layer)
- Add **Contextual** (cross-system integration)
- Add **Adaptive** (monitoring and drift detection)

**Target Result:** Production-ready agent in 3 weeks. Full INPACT™ infrastructure in 90 days.

*Note: Timeline targets vary based on organizational starting point and implementation approach.*

-----

## Why Act Now

Agent readiness isn't just infrastructure—it's competitive positioning.

Organizations that move first gain compounding advantages: better agents attract more users, more usage generates better data, better data enables even better agents. This creates a flywheel that's nearly impossible for late movers to catch.

The window is closing. According to Gartner, enterprises are rapidly locking in vendor relationships for AI infrastructure through 2026-2027. By 2028, switching costs will be prohibitive. The organizations building INPACT™ architecture now will own the advantage for the next decade.

The question isn't "Should we do this?" It's "Can we afford to wait?"

-----

## Understanding Expected Outcomes

The INPACT™ framework synthesizes patterns from extensive industry research and three decades of enterprise data system implementations. The MIT NANDA study shows 95% of GenAI projects fail; analysis of the 5% who succeed reveals consistent patterns—they address the six needs INPACT™ identifies, though not always explicitly or completely.

This framework is predictive, not prescriptive. It identifies what the successful minority does differently, based on:

- Published research on AI trust, model degradation, and enterprise adoption
- Industry reports from Gartner, McKinsey, and technology vendors
- Ram Katamaraja's 30 years implementing enterprise data systems
- Observable patterns in public case studies and vendor documentation

**Expected outcomes vary based on:**

**Implementation Completeness**

- All 6 needs addressed vs. partial implementation (3-4 needs)
- Organizations addressing fewer needs see proportionally lower returns

**Starting Position**

- ML-First enterprises (40-50% baseline readiness) move faster than BI-First (25-35%)
- Timeline to production: 60-120 days depending on archetype

**Execution Quality**

- Following systematic roadmaps vs. ad-hoc approaches
- Partnering with experienced implementers vs. solo builds (industry data shows 2-3x higher success with partners)

**Organizational Factors**

- Change management, executive sponsorship, cross-functional collaboration
- Data culture maturity and team capabilities

The pattern from industry research is clear: organizations that address these six architectural needs systematically show higher success rates. Those that skip needs or implement partially remain at significantly higher risk of remaining in the 95% that stall.

The book provides detailed implementation guidance, case study analysis, and ROI modeling frameworks. This article establishes the conceptual framework; execution and organizational factors determine outcomes.

## The Bottom Line

**Tony Robbins:** Six human needs unlock potential.

**INPACT™:** Six agent needs unlock trust.

Both are systems. Both require fulfillment. Both transform when needs are met.

The difference: humans flourish, agents deliver value.

The similarity: research shows unfulfilled needs are associated with significantly higher failure rates.

**Address them systematically or face significantly higher risk of joining the 95%.**
